# AI-Pacman-Assignment-_-Trinity-College-Dublin-

Work was done as a part of Artificial Intelligence Course at Trinity College Dublin using the AI Pacman program provided by UC Berkeley. 

The algorithms implemented include: 

1. Search Algorithms and Heuristics:

Uninformed search strategies: 
– Breadth-first search – Uniform-cost search – Depth-first search  

Informed Search strategy:  A Star Search 

2. Multi-Agent Search Algorithms: 
- Reflex Agent Optimization - MiniMax Algorithm - Alpha Beta Pruning
